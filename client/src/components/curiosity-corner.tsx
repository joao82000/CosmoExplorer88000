  {
    question: "How long would it take to drive to the Moon?",
    answer: "If you could drive at highway speed (60 mph) non-stop, it would take about 6 months to reach the Moon! The Moon is roughly 240,000 miles away.",
    category: "Solar System"
  },
  {
    question: "What would happen if you cried in space?",
    answer: "Your tears wouldn't fall down your face! In zero gravity, tears form bubbles around your eyes. They can only be removed by wiping them away.",
    category: "Physics"
  },
  {
    question: "How many Earths could fit inside the Sun?",
    answer: "About 1.3 million Earths! The Sun is so massive that it contains 99.86% of all the mass in our solar system.",
    category: "Solar System"
  },
  {
    question: "What's the most distant human-made object?",
    answer: "Voyager 1, launched in 1977, is now over 14 billion miles from Earth in interstellar space. It's still sending signals back to NASA!",
    category: "Technology"
  },
  {
    question: "Why is space completely silent?",
    answer: "Sound needs molecules to travel through, but space is mostly empty vacuum. That's why in movies, space explosions shouldn't make noise!",
    category: "Physics"
  },
  {
    question: "How fast does the International Space Station travel?",
    answer: "The ISS orbits Earth at about 17,500 mph! It completes one orbit around Earth every 90 minutes, giving astronauts 16 sunrises and sunsets per day.",
    category: "Technology"
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to your height in space?",
    answer: "Astronauts grow about 2 inches taller in space! Without gravity compressing their spine, they stretch out. They shrink back to normal when they return.",
    category: "Physics"
  },
  {
    question: "How cold is space?",
    answer: "Space is about -455Â°F (-270Â°C), just a few degrees above absolute zero. But in direct sunlight, objects can heat up to over 250Â°F!",
    category: "Physics"
  },
  {
    question: "What's the largest known star?",
    answer: "UY Scuti is so large that if placed at our Sun's location, it would extend beyond Jupiter's orbit! It's about 1,700 times wider than our Sun.",
    category: "Deep Space"
  },
  {
    question: "How many galaxies are there?",
    answer: "The observable universe contains an estimated 2 trillion galaxies! Each galaxy can contain hundreds of billions of stars.",
    category: "Deep Space"
  },
  {
    question: "What was the first food eaten in space?",
    answer: "Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first to eat in space in 1961. He squeezed beef and liver paste from a tube, followed by chocolate sauce!",
    category: "History"
  },
  {
    question: "How do rockets work in the vacuum of space?",
    answer: "Rockets work by Newton's third law - they push exhaust out the back, which pushes the rocket forward. They don't need air to 'push against'!",
